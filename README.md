# Implementing BERT to Improve Figure Usage Detection for Personal Health Mention Detection
### Claira Kauffmann, Akhila Ganti, Rachael Phillips

Personal health mention detection, predicting whether a text is a report of a health condition, has become even more prevalent as “social media has become a substitute for social interaction. This has caused an increase of medical and clinical-related information on the web” [LINK]. A unique use case occurred during COVID-19, when all interactions were brought online, many organizations tried to track the spread of the virus from social media, specifically Twitter. Similarly, we aim to improve the personal health mention predictions using more current models. Using the BioClinical BERT, we are seeing an F-1 score of 0.8726. We will show that utilizing more current BERT models to process the Twitter data, our PHM detection will improve.
